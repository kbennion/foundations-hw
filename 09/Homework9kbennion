if 'mag' >= 4.0
 print(eq_to_sentence(earthquakes))

Loop through each earthquake, printing sentence descriptions for the ones that are above or equal to 4.0 on the Richter scale.

PART FOUR: The other bits

If the earthquake is anything other than an earthquake (e.g. explosion or quarry blast), print

There was also a magnitude MAGNITUDE TYPE_OF_EVENT on DATE LOCATION.

For example,

There was also a magnitude 1.29 quarry blast on June 19 12km SE of Tehachapi, California.

with TYPE_OF_EVENT being explosion, quarry blast, etc and LOCATION being 'place' - e.g. '0km N of The Geysers, California'.
