    "SUMMARY is what it currently looks like (partly cloudy, etc - it's \"summary\" in the dictionary). Lowercase, please.\n",
    "TEMP_FEELING is whether it will be hot, warm, cold, or moderate. You will probably use HIGH_TEMP and your own thoughts and feelings to determine this.\n",
    "HIGH_TEMP is the high temperature for the day.\n",

    "RAIN_WARNING is something like \"bring your umbrella!\" if it is going to rain at some point during the day.\n",

    "You can take a look at the documentation, but \"current\" contains the current conditions and the first element of \"daily\" is for the current day.\n",

    "Using a mailgun.com account and their API, send yourself an email every morning at 8AM telling you the above sentence. The subject line of the email should be something like \"8AM Weather forecast: January 1, 1970\""
